# poetry-generation-using-bigrams-python
This Python script utilizes the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) library to generate poetry based on bigrams. The process involves analyzing a given text file (in this case, 'ghalib.txt' and 'iqbal.txt') to create a frequency distribution of bigrams, and then using this information to generate stanzas of poetry.
